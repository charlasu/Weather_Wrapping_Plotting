# Weather_Wrapping_Plotting
Evaluation of metrics that proves, yes, the weather changes as you approach the equator.


Unfortunately, I cannot seem to get the .loc data back into the dataframe. And in working with my tutor, he could only do it for "windspeed" and not the others, and then by using the soon-to-be-deprecated .set_value command. That said, I never got to plotting, which is so frustrating, but needed to move on after investing so many hours :-/

Would love to do an office hours session with either Alex or Darius to try to solve. It's gnawing at me!
